The [Amazon MQ Workshop](/README.md) introduces the relevant concepts and features of a message driven application using [Amazon MQ](https://aws.amazon.com/amazon-mq/). You will learn how to set-up an Amazon MQ broker and how to connect senders and receivers to exchange messages. This also includes using different protocols to demonstrate the protocol interoperability features Amazon MQ provides.

We will dive into the security and monitoring features Apache Active MQ provides out of the box, and what Amazon MQ adds on top of them.  

We will also look at how the broker fail-over works in a Multi-AZ set-up and how long does it takes.  

At the end, we will look at how to integrate the broker with AWS Lambda.
