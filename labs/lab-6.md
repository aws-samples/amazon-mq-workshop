After the broker is again in the status `Running`, run the following command in a terminal tab in the Cloud9 IDE (first replace the parameter **<....>** with the value you have chosen):

``` bash
java -jar amazon-mq-client.jar -url $url -user user2 -password <user 2 password> -mode sender -type queue -destination queue.user1 -name user1
```

You should see a log output like the following:

``` bash
[ActiveMQ Task-1] INFO org.apache.activemq.transport.failover.FailoverTransport - Successfully connected to ssl://b-4e4bfd69-7b83-4a27-9faf-4684cfa80443-2.mq.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com:61617
Error: User user2 is not authorized to write to: queue://queue.user1
```

This indicates that `user2` is not authorized to write into this queue. Try to see what happens if you read messages from this queue or read/write from/to another one.

When you change the user from `user2` to `user1` and read from `queue.user1`, you should see the following log output which indicates that you can successfully write to `queue.user1`.

``` bash
[ActiveMQ Task-1] INFO org.apache.activemq.transport.failover.FailoverTransport - Successfully connected to ssl://b-4e4bfd69-7b83-4a27-9faf-4684cfa80443-2.mq.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com:61617
12.04.2018 18:49:43.511 - Sender: sent '[queue://workshop.user1] [user1] Message number 1'
12.04.2018 18:49:43.543 - Sender: sent '[queue://workshop.user1] [user1] Message number 2'
12.04.2018 18:49:43.567 - Sender: sent '[queue://workshop.user1] [user1] Message number 3'
...
```


13\. Stop the sender by holding `CTRL + c` in the terminal.
