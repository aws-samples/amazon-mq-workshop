# Lab 2: Using Point-To-Point Messaging Using Queues

In this exercise you learn how to do Point-To-Point messaging with Amazon MQ using queues. The behavior of a message queue is that each message is consumed by one receiver, so that there is a 1:1 relationship between sender and receiver for each published message.

You will find the source code of this client [here](/amazon-mq-client/src/main/java/com/aws/sample/amazonmq/AmazonMqClient.java).

### 1. Prerequisites

You should have an Amazon MQ broker running and have configured the necessary environment variable as per the guide below.

<details><summary>Store environment variable</summary><p>

To make it easier to run the commands in the following labs we store frequently used parameters like Amazon MQ broker user, password, etc. in Bash environment variables.

Go to the [AmazonMQ console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/amazon-mq), and click on the name of the broker (the one with a name starting with the stack name you created)

Scroll down to the Connections section and click the **Copy failover string** link beside the OpenWire row 
to copy the string to your clipboard.

Go to the [CloudFormation console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation) and select the stack that you launched at the beginning of the workshop. In the Output tab shown in the lower part of the screen you will have a Cloud9ConsoleURL entry. Click on the URL and enter **aws** as username and **mq** as password. 
 Once the Cloud9 IDE has launched, select the terminal window at the bottom and enter the following commands, one at the time, replacing the values **<...>** with the value you have chosen during the creation of the stack.

``` bash
export temp_url="<failover url>"
echo "url=\"$temp_url\"" >> ~/.bashrc; source ~/.bashrc
```

**NOTE**: Ensure that all terminals windows that you will use for the workshop are crated after having run this step.

</p></details><p/>

### 2. Go to the Cloud9 IDE tab in the browser

In the main pane, close the Welcome screen and add 4  terminal tabs (click on + tab and select New Terminal. Reorganize them in a chequered pattern using the mouse and select the top left terminal.
All terminals should be in the `/workspace` directory.

Run the following command in the top-left terminal to start the sender. The sender name is added to the message to identify who is sending the message:

``` bash
java -jar amazon-mq-client.jar -url $url -user $user -password $password -mode sender -type queue -destination workshop.queueA -name Sender-1
```

You should see a log output like the following:

``` bash
[ActiveMQ Task-1] INFO org.apache.activemq.transport.failover.FailoverTransport - Successfully connected to ssl://b-4e4bfd69-7b83-4a27-9faf-4684cfa80443-1.mq.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com:61617
14.04.2018 11:33:03.609 - Sender: sent '[queue://workshop.queueA] [Sender-1] Message number 1'
14.04.2018 11:33:04.645 - Sender: sent '[queue://workshop.queueA] [Sender-1] Message number 2'
14.04.2018 11:33:05.680 - Sender: sent '[queue://workshop.queueA] [Sender-1] Message number 3'
...
```

Select the top-right terminal and start a second sender. Now you have 2 clients sending messages to the same **queue**. Use a different name on order to distinguish the sender of the messages:

``` bash
java -jar amazon-mq-client.jar -url $url -user $user -password $password -mode sender -type queue -destination workshop.queueA -name Sender-2
```

Select the lower-left terminal. Run the following command, to start the first receiver:

``` bash
java -jar amazon-mq-client.jar -url $url -user $user -password $password -mode receiver -type queue -destination workshop.queueA
```

You should see a log output like the following:

``` bash
[ActiveMQ Task-1] INFO org.apache.activemq.transport.failover.FailoverTransport - Successfully connected to ssl://b-4e4bfd69-7b83-4a27-9faf-4684cfa80443-1.mq.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com:61617
14.04.2018 11:47:41.616 - Receiver: received '[queue://workshop.queueA] [Sender-1] Message number 1'
14.04.2018 11:47:41.620 - Receiver: received '[queue://workshop.queueA] [Sender-1] Message number 2'
...
14.04.2018 11:47:41.622 - Receiver: received '[queue://workshop.queueA] [Sender-2] Message number 1'
14.04.2018 11:47:41.623 - Receiver: received '[queue://workshop.queueA] [Sender-2] Message number 2'
...
```

Select the lower-right terminal and start a second receiver. You now have 2 clients listening on the same **queue**:

``` bash
java -jar amazon-mq-client.jar -url $url -user $user -password $password -mode receiver -type queue -destination workshop.queueA
```

You can see that multiple senders can send messages to the same queue, and multiple receivers can receive messages from the same queue. But you will also observe that each message is only **delivered to one receiver**, not both. You also observer that there is no direct relationship between sender and receiver. Try to stop/start the receiver to see what changes.

### 3. Clean-up

Stop the sender and receiver by holding `CTRL + C` or  `CONTROL + C` in each terminal window.
