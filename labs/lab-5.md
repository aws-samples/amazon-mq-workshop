# Lab 5: Set-Up Amazon CloudWatch to Monitor Our Broker

In this lab we will have a closer look at broker, queue and topic metrics provided via CloudWatch metrics. We also create a CloudWatch alarm which triggers an e-mail as soon as there are messages in the **ActiveMQ.DLQ** queue. The **ActiveMQ.DLQ** queue is a special queue used by Amazon MQ to store messages that failed to be processed multiple times (so called "poison messages").

#Go to the Cloud9 IDE tab in the browser

In the main pane, close the Welcome screen and add 1  terminal tab. Run the following command to send a few message to a queue where no receiver is listening to:

``` bash
java -jar amazon-mq-client.jar -url $url -user $user -password $password -mode sender -type queue -destination workshop.DLQTest -name Sender-1 -ttl 1000
```

> Note the `ttl` option. This means the message has a life time of only 1 second. All messages which are not consumed before the ttl expires are moved to the **ActiveMQ.DLQ** queue by default.

You should see a log output like the following:

``` bash
[ActiveMQ Task-1] INFO org.apache.activemq.transport.failover.FailoverTransport - Successfully connected to ssl://b-4e4bfd69-7b83-4a27-9faf-4684cfa80443-1.mq.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com:61617
14.04.2018 11:33:03.609 - Sender: sent '[queue://workshop.DLQTest] [Sender-1] Message number 1'
14.04.2018 11:33:04.645 - Sender: sent '[queue://workshop.DLQTest] [Sender-1] Message number 2'
14.04.2018 11:33:05.680 - Sender: sent '[queue://workshop.DLQTest] [Sender-1] Message number 3'
...
```

### 3. Working with Amazon CloudWatch Alarms

Click on the bell image for the first broker to create a new CloudWatch Alarm. Enter the following values:

* Name: `Failed message delivery from broker workshop-1`
* Description: `Failed message delivery from broker workshop-1`
* Whenever: `<see screenshot>`
* Treat missing data as: `good`
