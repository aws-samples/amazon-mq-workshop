# Lab 4: Testing a Broker Fail-over

In this lab you will have a running sender and receiver producing and consuming messages while you issue a Broker reboot. You will see how long the clients are not able to send and receive messages before they successfully reconnect to the broker.

### 1. Navigate to the Amazon MQ Brokers page

</p></details><p/>

### 2. Copy the Connection String

Click on the name of the broker, you created in lab 1 and scroll a bit down to the **Connections** section. Copy the **OpenWire** fail-over connection url, by clicking on the **Copy failover string (Java)** link on the right site.

### 3. Open an SSH session to your EC2 instance

Open an SSH session to your EC2 instance and start a **tmux** session by running:

```
tmux
```

To split your terminal window into 2 individual screens, run the following commands:

```
CTRL + b "
CTRL + b [arrow key up]
```

Run the following command from the top screen, to start the sender:

``` bash
java -jar amazon-mq-client.jar -url $url -user $user -password $password -mode sender -type queue -destination workshop.queueA -name Sender-1
```

You should see a log output like the following:

``` bash
[ActiveMQ Task-1] INFO org.apache.activemq.transport.failover.FailoverTransport - Successfully connected to ssl://b-4e4bfd69-7b83-4a27-9faf-4684cfa80443-2.mq.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com:61617
12.04.2018 12:00:58.369 - Sender: sent '[queue://workshop.queueA] [Sender-1] Message number 1'
12.04.2018 12:00:58.395 - Sender: sent '[queue://workshop.queueA] [Sender-1] Message number 2'
12.04.2018 12:00:58.419 - Sender: sent '[queue://workshop.queueA] [Sender-1] Message number 3'
...
```

Type `CTRL + b [arrow key down]` to switch to the bottom screen and run the following command to start the receiver:

``` bash
java -jar amazon-mq-client.jar -url $url -user $user -password $password -mode receiver -type queue -destination workshop.queueA
```

You should see a log output like the following:

``` bash
[ActiveMQ Task-1] INFO org.apache.activemq.transport.failover.FailoverTransport - Successfully connected to ssl://b-4e4bfd69-7b83-4a27-9faf-4684cfa80443-2.mq.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com:61617
12.04.2018 12:01:03.672 - Receiver: received '[queue://workshop.queueA] [Sender-1] Message number 1'
12.04.2018 12:01:03.772 - Receiver: received '[queue://workshop.queueA] [Sender-1] Message number 2'
12.04.2018 12:01:03.673 - Receiver: received '[queue://workshop.queueA] [Sender-1] Message number 3'
...
```

Scroll to the top of your brokers details page and click on `Actions -> Reboot broker`.

Shortly after, you should see an exception in both consoles because the primary broker isn't reachable any 	more. After waiting a few more seconds, you should see a successful reconnect from your clients to the secondary broker, which is now the new primary one (compare the connection urls):

The sender console log output should look similar to this one:

Stop the sender and receiver by holding `CTRL + c` in each tmux screen. To terminate the active tmux screen, type `CTRL + d`.
