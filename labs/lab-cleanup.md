# Workshop Cleanup

Before we finish this workshop, let's delete all resources we have created so that no further costs are incurred. 


1\. Navigate to the [AWS CloudFormation console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation), select the stack we have created earlier and choose **Actions -> Delete Stack**. On the next page, confirm it by clicking **Yes, delete**.
