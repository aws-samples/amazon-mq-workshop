# Workshop Setup

To begin this workshop, **click one of the 'Deploy to AWS' buttons below for the region you'd like to use**. This is the AWS region where you will launch resources for the duration of this workshop. This will open the CloudFormation template in the AWS Management Console for the region you select.

Once you have chosen a region and are inside the AWS CloudFormation Console, you should be on a screen titled "Select Template". We are providing CloudFormation with a template on your behalf, by providing a S3 template URL. Click the blue **Next** button to proceed.

Your stack will take sometime to launch, mostrly due to the creation of the Amazon MQ broker. You can track its progress in the "Events" tab. When it is done creating, the status will change to "CREATE_COMPLETE".

Once the creation has completed, you can look-up the URL to access the Cloud9 IDE in the line "Cloud9ConsoleUrl". Click on this URL to open the Cloud9 editor and enter *aws* as username and *mq* as password.
It can take sometime to launch the IDE the first time.
