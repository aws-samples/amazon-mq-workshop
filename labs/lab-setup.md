Once you have chosen a region and are inside the AWS CloudFormation Console, you should be on a screen titled "Select Template". We are providing CloudFormation with a template on your behalf, by providing a S3 template URL. Click the blue **Next** button to proceed.

On the following screen, "Specify Details", your Stack is pre-populated with the name "amazonmqworkshop". You can customize that to a name of your choice **less than 15 characters in length** or leave as is. The user launching the stack (you) already has the necessary permissions. Click **Next**.

> An IAM role will also be created and this role will be added to the EC2 instance you are using during this workshop. On deletion of the stack, these resources will be deleted for you.

Your stack will take about 3 minutes to launch and you can track its progress in the "Events" tab. When it is done creating, the status will change to "CREATE_COMPLETE".

On the "Outputs" tab in CloudFormation, you can look-up the public IP address of your EC2 instance in the line "EC2IP" and the URL to access the Cloud9 IDE in the line "Cloud9ConsoleUrl". Click on this URL to open the Cloud9 editor and enter *aws* as username and *mq* as password.
It can take sometime to launch the IDE the first time.
